   <h2>Lightning Safety in Forests</h2>
   <p>During a lightning storm in a forest, avoid tall, isolated trees and open clearings. Seek shelter under a  group of shorter, dense trees or low shrubs. Stay away from metal objects and high ground like ridges or hilltops. Crouch down with your feet together, keeping your head low, but don’t lie flat. Avoid touching trees or rocks, as they can conduct electricity. Always wait at least 30 minutes after the last thunder before moving. Staying calm and following these steps can help keep you safe.

   <h2>Respect Wildlife: Observe Without Disturbing</h2>
   <p>When exploring natural areas, keep a safe distance from all animals and avoid approaching or feeding them. Disturbing wildlife can cause unnecessary stress, disrupt feeding or mating behaviors, and even lead to abandonment of young. Always observe quietly and move slowly to avoid startling animals. Never try to touch or chase wildlife, as this can be dangerous for both you and the animals. Remember, wild animals are best appreciated in their natural habitat without interference. By respecting their space, you help protect delicate ecosystems and ensure that wildlife can thrive undisturbed.

   <h2>Protect Nature: Don't Throw Trash in the Wild</h2>
   <p>When enjoying the outdoors, never throw trash on the ground or leave it behind. Litter harms wildlife, pollutes water sources, and damages fragile ecosystems. Always carry out what you bring in by using designated trash bins or packing your waste with you. Keeping nature clean helps preserve its beauty and health for everyone to enjoy. Small actions make a big difference—respect the environment and leave no trace.
