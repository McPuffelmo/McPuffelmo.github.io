   <h1>Do you know which animals live in the Grand Canyon Nationalpark?</h1>
   <h2>Here's a small list to name a few.</h2>
  </div>
  <br>
  <ul class="Borders" id="List">
   <li><div class="Animals">Coyotes</div> are medium-sized, dog-like animals with pointed ears, bushy tails, and grayish fur. In the Grand Canyon, they live in diverse habitats, from forests to desert areas. Coyotes are often seen alone or in small groups, and their howls can be heard at night. They are opportunistic eaters, feeding on small animals, insects, and carrion, making them well-adapted to life in the canyon.</li>
   <br>
   <br>
   <li><div class="Animals">Bobcats</div> are medium-sized wild cats with short tails, tufted ears, and spotted coats. In the Grand Canyon, they are secretive and mostly active at night, spending their days resting in rock crevices or hollow trees. Bobcats are solitary hunters, preying mainly on small mammals and birds, but they can take down larger animals when needed. Their adaptability and stealth help them thrive in the canyonâ€™s rugged terrain.</li>
   <br>
   <li><div class="Animals">Rock squirrels</div> are large, grayish-brown rodents with bushy tails edged in white. They live in rocky areas throughout the Grand Canyon, such as cliffs and canyon walls. Active during the day, they forage for pine nuts, insects, and sometimes carrion. Rock squirrels live in colonies, dig burrows for shelter, and are known for their bold behavior around humans, sometimes even biting if approached too closely.</li>
   <br>
   <li><div class="Animals">Desert bighorn sheep</div> are sturdy animals with curved horns and a sandy-colored coat that helps them blend into the rocky Grand Canyon terrain. They live in steep, rugged areas where they use their agility to climb cliffs and escape predators. These sheep graze on grasses, shrubs, and cacti, and often gather in small herds for protection and social interaction. Their sure-footedness and keen senses make them well adapted to the harsh canyon environment.</li>
